<p class="style1">Hello, my name is Jonathan Frei</p>

<p class="style1">I do Digital Marketing for <a href="http://neogenomics.com" target="_blank">NeoGenomics Laboratories</a> in Fort Myers, FL. Prior to that I was the Director of Marketing for <a href="http://desco-soft.com" target="_blank">dESCO, LLC</a>. You can check my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanfrei" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> for more info about me.</p> 

<p class="style2" id="social">I tweet at <a href="http://twitter.com/jonathanfrei" target="_blank">@jonathanfrei</a> and blog at <a href="http://blog.jonathanfrei.com" target="_blank">blog.jonathanfrei.com</a> and you can talk to me at jonathanelliotfrei [at] gmail [dot] com.</p> 

<p class="style2" id="subscribe">Get updates from my blog by <a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/jonathanfreitumblr"> subscribing here</a>.</p>

<p class="style1">This is my website, my hub, and your portal to everything I do on the web. Here you'll find links to my blog, social profiles, work sites, writings and ways to contact me.  I suggest you start out by learning <a href="#about-me"> more about me</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About: Who I Am</h2>

<p>This is the section that prompted me to write this whole page. When I started my job at NeoGenomics I got a homework assignment. I was supposed to write a short bio for the company newsletter. After starting, I discovered how hard it was for me to write about myself. I even tried doing it in the third person to remove myself from the picture. After a small amount of effort I gave up and asked <a href="http://www.gabrielafrei.com" target="_blank">Gabi</a> my wife to write it for me. She did and <a href="http://blog.jonathanfrei.com/post/12191921101/neonews-bio" target="_blank">excellent job of it</a>, and inspired me to write my own about me. </p>

<p>Her good work made me realize it had been a while since I took a good look at myself in the mirror. I should not be afraid to talk about myself, and so this site is an attempt to remedy that problem. </p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills: What I do and How I Do It</h2>

<p>Through my work and education I've learned several valuable skills. Below is a short list of some of the once that have served me well recently. </p>

<h3>Web Development</h3>

<p>I made this website and <a href="http://desco-soft.com" target="_blank">this one</a> and have done extensive work on <a href="http://www.neogenomics.com" target="_blank">this one</a>. I launched jonathanfrei.com as a lifestyle blog in 2008. It still lives on a <a href="http://jonathanfrei.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Blogger domain here</a>. </p>

<p>I'm very familiar with HTML and CSS and am good with several CMS platforms such as Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr, and more. </p>

<h3>Salesforce.com</h3>

<p>I've been using Salesforce.com since 2008, started using it extensivly in 2009, and now do a lot of extensive customization, developing custom objects and deploying it for a large enterprise. </p>

<h3>Search Engine Marketing</h3>

<p>I optimize the websites I work on so search engines and rank them high and so visitors find what they're looking for. </p>

<h3>Web Advertising</h3>

<p>I run successful pay per click ad campaigns that bring new qualified visitors and convert those visitors into leads. </p>

<h3>Email Marketing</h3>

<p>I launch email campaigns that educate prospects and generate sales. </p>

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<p>I'm proud to have worked at some really great companies with some really great people. I've done some very interesting jobs but have now settled in to being a digital marketer. I love companies with non-traditional capitalization. </p>

<h3>Digital Marketing Specialist: <a href="http://www.neogenomics.com" target="_blank">NeoGenomics Laboratories</a></h3>

<p>I started working as the Digital Marketing Specialist for NeoGenomics in October 2011. My job includes managing all digital marketing efforts like the website, social media, email marketing. I am also responsible for Salesforce.com in the sales and marketing departments and for the NeoGenomics University training portal. </p>

<h3>Director of Marketing and Business Development: <a href="http://desco-soft.com" target="_blank">dESCO, LLC</a></h3>

<p>I managed all the marketing activities for dESCO, a software developer that makes management applications for service companies from January 2010 to September 2011. </p>

<h3>Account Executive: <a href="http://www.mediabrains.com" target="_blank">MediaBrains</a>, 2009</h3>

<p>I sold ad space to small and medium sized businesses in MediaBrains' online network of business-to-business industry directories from January 2009 to December 2009. </p>

<h3>Recreation Supervisor: <a href="/#">City of Steubenville, Recreation Department</a>, 2006-2008</h3>

<h3>City Beat Journalist/Photographer: <a href="http://hsconnect.com" target="_blank">Herald-Star Newspaper</a>, 2006</h3>

<h3>Head Lifeguard: <a href="/#">City of La Crosse, Recreation Department</a>,</h3>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>I spent my childhood in a number of different schools, and kept that trend up through college. I am done with my formal education, but will always want to keep learning. If I do go back to school again, my plan will be to get accepted into an Ive League, like Harvard or Stanford, and then drop out after a semester. It seems like many of the most successful businessmen are college dropouts, and I plan to learn from their example. </p>

<h3>MBA, Franciscan University of Steubenville, 2006-2008,</h3>

<p>I completed my MBA between 2006 and 2008. I did several independent studies during my time, and focused my courses on marketing and economics. </p>

<h3>B.A., English (Writing), Franciscan University of Steubenville, 2003-2005</h3>

<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in English (Writing) between September 2003 and December 2005. I finished my undergrad in 2.5 years, probably because I graduated before I turned 21 and could drink. </p>

<h3>Western Wisconsin Technical College, 2002-2003</h3>

<p>I spent my senior year of high school taking college classes and only showed up to my high school building twice during the school year: once to pick up my student ID and once to pick up my ACT application. I did not attend my high school graduation. </p>

<p>I didn't take a degree from WWTC, but my courses were in computer science, photography, TV production, digital media, and other general education course. </p>

<h3>Central High School, 2001-2002</h3>

<h3>Aquinas High School</h3>

<h3>Middle School, Elementary School, and Earlier</h3>
